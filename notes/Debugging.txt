// HTML

What we will go over in this section:
1. Identify common errors in programming
2. Explain good practices to avoid making errors

Always check for mistyped things.


- DO NOT name a class or id with a NUMBER
- 

//Rule-based error
// Knowledge based errors
//Common errors


- Write CSS in short hand syntax
for example: margin: 0 0 0 0;

use this for every css:

* {
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
}


//          HANDLING errors


- CSS handles errors differently
- This code does not break or stop executing
- Code with errors is ignored
