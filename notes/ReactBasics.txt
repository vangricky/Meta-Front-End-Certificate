// MODULE EXPORTS
1. Default Exports 
2. Named Exports


// Default Exports
- You can have ONE DEFAULT EXPORT per JavaScript module
'export default function'
'export default'
------------------------
function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

export default addTwo;
------------------------

// Named Exports
- You can export as many times as you want

------------------------
export function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

export function addThree(a + b + c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
}
-------------------------

Another way to do named exports are:

-------------------------

function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

function addThree(a + b + c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
}

export { addTwo, addThree };

-------------------------
