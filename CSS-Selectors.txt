//Combination Selectors

There are '4' types of combination selections, and they are...
1. Descendant Selectors (using space)
2. Child Selectors (>)
3. General Sibling Selectors (~)
4. Adjacent Sibling Selectors (+)

Below, I will type an example code. Below the example code, I will explain each Combination Selectors

<div id="blog">
    <h1>Latest News</h1>
    <div>
    <h1>Weather Forecast</h1>
    <p>The weather will be sunny</p>
    <p>Tomorrow will be rainy.</p>
    </div>
</div>

'Descendant Selectors': Elements contained within another selector 
example: #blog h1 {}

'Child Selectors': Instead of space, its more specific. You first select a person, then select their immidiate children with a specific value
example: #blog > h1 {}
this is the case, because we see that there '2' h1's. If you only want to customize the FIRST h1, use a CHILD SELECTOR.
the output will be: the 1st h1 will be customized, and the second h1 will be just normal and untouched,

'General Sibling Selectors': Allow you to select a person, then select all younger brothers 
example: h1 ~ p {}
output: all p's under the h1 element will be customized

'Adjacent Sibling Selectors': Use adjacent selectors to target only the first, or adjacent, element 
that follows another element.
example: div + p {}



// Pseudo-classes: state-based selectors
for example: 
':hover'
in focus
visited link
specific Elements

Syntax (this is how to write a pseudo class in the css document):
seletor:pseudo-class {
    property: value
}


User Action States:
1. :hover (something happens when the user 'hovers' over the element)
2. :active (something happens when the user clicks on the element)
3. :focus



// Form States
1. :disabled and :enabled
2. :checked and :indeterminate
3. :valid and :invalid


// Specific Position-Based States
1. :first-of-type
2. :last-of-type
3. :nth-of-type()
4. :nth-last-of-type()

// Imagine we have text in a few list points. If we want to just change the color of the FIRST letter in each list, this is 
what you will have to do:

li::first-letter {
    color: coral;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 20px
}

// BELOW: will make the first line of text have an underline

li::first-line {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
// BELOW: will change the style of the bullet point of the li
li::marker {
    color: cornflowerblue;
    content: '>>'
}

//BELOW: will change the style of when you click, hold, and drag the text, it will change the color and such

li::selection {
    color:brown;
    background-color: antiquewhite;
}

.(classname)::before {

}

.(classname)::after {

}



// Web-link States


:link
:visited


// THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO WRITE
LVHA
link, visited, hover, active
